# machine-learning

## I began to study Machine Learning of Andrew Ng in bilibili last year, but at that time I didn't have any homework because the theory is hard for me. A year later, with relatively complete mathematical knowledge, I found that the basic theory of machine learning is not so obscure .Machine learning is a wonderful branches of computer science whitch attracts me a lot. So I decide to push my homework of this course on github. All the exercises are use Matlab to program, and for me,it is a  new language.    

### Thanks a lot for Andrew Ng! He is a good teacher and his course is easy to learn. Wish you can try it also!
